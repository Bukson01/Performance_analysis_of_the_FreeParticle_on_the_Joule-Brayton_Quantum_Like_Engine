# Performance_analysis_of_the_FreeParticle_on_the_Joule-Brayton_Quantum_Like_Engine


This MATLAB script computes the dimensionless power output and the maximum dimensionless power output of a free particle in a Joule-Brayton-like quantum engine. The code is based on the theoretical framework laid out by L. Guzman Vargas, V. Granados, and R. D. Mota in their paper "Efficiency of simple quantum engines: The Joule-Brayton and Otto cycles", and further extended using methods described by Enock et al. in their work "The performance analysis of a Quantum-Mechanical Carnot-like Engine using Diatomic Molecules".

## Background

The script analyzes the power output of a free particle in a quantum engine by computing the dimensionless power and determining the maximum dimensionless power achievable. It utilizes symbolic mathematics in MATLAB to perform differentiation and solve equations to find critical points.

## Features

- Computes the dimensionless power output of a free particle in a quantum engine.
- Determines the maximum dimensionless power output.
- Plots the dimensionless power versus length ratio to visualize the relationship.

## Acknowledgements

- The theoretical framework is based on the work of L. Guzman Vargas, V. Granados, and R. D. Mota.
- Methodological insights were drawn from the research conducted by Enock et al.

## Usage

1. Run the MATLAB script `FP_on_JB.m`.
2. The script will compute the dimensionless power and display the maximum values, if any.
3. A plot of dimensionless power versus length ratio will be generated.
